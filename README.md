This is the repository for the Lancaster chapter of Papers We Love. As a local chapter we follow the Papers We Love [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/papers-we-love/lancaster/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) and the [Seminar Discussion]() guidelines.

### Welcome
The world we live on today wasn't built in a day. It was built over many years by all kinds of people who contributed and built on each other's work to create the marvellous technological society we live in. 

One can simply accept things as they are and move on with life. We like to peek behind the curtain and see how the machinery runs. _Papers We Love Lancaster_ seeks to further the community's understanding of the computer, the programs that enable our society to function, the algorithms that accomplish problems in record time, and all other facets that this weird, and wonderful field has to offer.

We will study academic papers from the Papers We Love archive as well as those in the ACM and IEEE digital libraries. In addition to reviewing the paper, we will study the underlying assumptions and context in ideas were conceived. I hope you enjoy the time you spend with us as much as I do. 


### Meetups
We will use Meetup to meet with one another and have our discussions before it is deemed safe to meet in person. Anyone from around the world is welcome to join our meetups online. The schedule of our meetups will be confirmed once we get a cadence going.
